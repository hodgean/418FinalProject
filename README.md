# 418 Final Project - Earthquake Prediction

## App Overview

>Data was read in with a .csv file from United States Geological Survey (USGS).  The first tab in the app was dedicated to displaying the dataset for all the earthquakes that USGS provides.  It shows things like specific values for the location and time of the earthquake as well as the name of the place the earthquake happened.  Multiple datasets were available through USGS, and one of these datasets included significant earthquakes in the last month.  I found on their website that this significance is calculated by adding the maximum of magnitude and paper signicance with the dyfi significance.  Using this dataset, I added another tab on the app that displays essentially the same things as the first dataset, but only showing significant earthquakes over the past 30 days.  As far as predicting earthquakes goes, it is important to note that an exact science for predicting earthquakes isn't necessarily available with today's modern technologies.  Earthquakes are highly unpredictable, as are many other natural disasters.  However, there are many different methods and techniques used to at least try and provide an accurate prediction for things like natural disasters and in this case earthquakes.  The basic method of approach was a usage of time series analysis, which actually had some friendly packages for use in R programming.  Usually, time series data is a sequence recorded at equal intervals of time.  Time series models are particularly good at picking up trends and patterns, and for that reason is very popular and widely used for observing how given variables change over time and predicting things like weather. In this case, the ARIMA and spectral time series techniques were applied to produce graphs and make predictions.  ARIMA, or autoregressive integrated moving average, is used to measure events that happen over a period of time.  In this case, the ARIMA model is able to use past earthquake data to forecast future earthquake data.  In addition, ACF (autocorrelation) and PACF (partial autocorrelation) models were created to visually display the correlation between data points at a given time.  These both show correlation between time series values, where the PACF accounts for the values in between the intervals.  Spectral analysis, much like the ARIMA model, is able to use past earthquake data to forecast future eathquake data.  Essentially, it measures the strength of periodic components of a signal at different frequencies and uses the Fourier transform to decompose waveforms into usable frequencies.  Also, a periodogram was produced to visually display the dominant periods (or frequencies) of this time series.  Tabs were created in the shiny app for each of the time series techniques, as well as corresponding dropdown tabs for the respective foreasting and graphs.
